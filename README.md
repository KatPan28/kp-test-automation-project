## üîß IDE Setup

### 1. Lombok Plugin for IntelliJ

- Go to `Settings` ‚Üí `Plugins`
- Search for **Lombok**, install it, and restart IntelliJ
- Enable annotation processing:
    - `Settings` ‚Üí `Build, Execution, Deployment` ‚Üí `Compiler` ‚Üí `Annotation Processors`
    - ‚úÖ Check **Enable annotation processing**

---

## üß™ Test Execution

You can run the tests using either **Gradle** or directly from your **IDE**.

### ‚úÖ 1. Run via Gradle

```bash
./gradlew clean test
```

- Cleans previous builds and runs all tests using TestNG
- Uses testng.xml for suite configuration
- Generates a detailed ExtentReport after execution

### ‚úÖ 2. Run via IntelliJ (TestNG XML)

- Through testng.xml config file
    - `Right-click on testng.xml` ‚Üí `Select Run testng.xml`
- Run a specific test class or method
    - `Open the desired test class or method` ‚Üí `Right-click inside the method or class name` ‚Üí
      `Select **Run 'ClassName.methodName()'**`

### ‚úÖ 3. Run via GitHub Actions (CI)

This project includes GitHub Actions workflow support for automated test execution on every push or
pull request.

- Can be started automatically on push/pull request or **manually from the Workflows tab**
- Uses `./gradlew clean test` internally to execute the full test suite
- After test execution, the HTML report (`ExtentReport.html`) is uploaded as an artifact

#### ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to use it:

- **To run automatically:** Push your code to a tracked branch (e.g., `main` or
  `feature/your-feature`)
- **To run manually:**
    1. Go to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repository
    2. Select the workflow named (e.g., `API Tests`)
    3. Click the **Run workflow** button on the right side
    4. Choose the branch to run on (optional) and confirm
- After the workflow completes, open the **Actions** tab
- Select the latest workflow run
- Download the test report from the **Artifacts** section (named `ExtentReport`)

## üìà Test Report

You can retrieve test reports after running locally or in CI.
The extended test automation report includes metrics such as:

- Test pass/fail status
- Execution time

  Tests divided by categories for better test report analytics

### ‚úÖ 1. Test Report after local execution

- After local test execution (steps are mention above)
    - `Navigate to the `build/reports` folder ` ‚Üí
      `Open "ExtentReport.html" in your browser to view the detailed report`

### ‚úÖ 2. Test Report as attachments in CI

- When running tests via CI (e.g., GitHub Actions):
    - `The report is generated automatically and uploaded as an artifact` ‚Üí
      `You can download the "ExtentReport.html" file from the workflow run's **Artifacts** section in
          the CI UI`
